'''
Write a script that demonstrates TDD. Using pseudocode, plan out a couple simple functions. They could be
as simple as add and subtract or more complex such as functions that read and write to files.

Instead of writing out the functions, only provide the tests. Think about how the functions might
fail and write tests that will check and prevent failure.

You do not need to implement the actual functions after writing the tests but you may.

'''

'''this test verifies if the file gets input appended to if the word is longer than 20 chars'''

'''this yet another test checks if the function workf for both int and float types'''

'''this test verified if the function returs true if both arguments are true '''
